        <h3>Welcome to my blog	&#128037 </h3>
  
        <p>
        Hello, Kia Ora, Hola!
        I am Justine. I'm a member of the #2022_piwakawaka cohort in Wellington. As you may have guessed from my blog, I am a noobie at coding. 
        Nonetheless, I will be posting weekly blogs about technical web-development concepts (as I learn them) while completing #Foundations. 
        I have been involved with hackathons as a non-tech person in the past; I am excited to code STUFF and I am looking forward to bootcamp!
        I am a fairly extroverted person and enjoy a chat - especially chats about ideas and problem-solving!
        </p>
