        <h2> Bootcamp Learning Plan </h2>

        <h3> What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
            <P>
                I am hoping to use the skills I gain at EDA to help individuals, families, and communities through the 
                positive use of internet-related technologies.  As I am also a primary caregiver to a toddler, 
                I  do not have a grand-destination in mind regarding my next career step - the goal is more holistic.  
                I would like to find flexible employment that will allow me to continue to grow my tech skills while 
                engaging my experience in “helping” skills. 
            </P>

        <h3> What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp? </h3>
            <p>
                My biggest strength is that I like fast moving environments that involve creative ideation and teamwork.  
                My technical skills will be a weakness, which will intensify if I focus on this element of my skills too much and measure 
                my contribution to the group based on coding skills alone. There will probably be some instances where I am embarrassed by my 
                level of technical skills, it will important that I don't let this emotional reaction interfere with my learning too much. 
            </p>

        <h3> What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
            <p>
                I expect that I will feel quite overwhelmed at the end of each week.  
                This feeling may build up and start to erode my ability to concentrate.  
                I will have to make an effort to be aware of my own internal state and need for timeout. 
            </p>

        <h3> What non-technical skills (human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy? </h3>
            <p>
                Can I say all of them? 
            </p>                                                                          

        <h3> What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team? </h3>
            <P>
                I really just expect what you have outlined that you will provide.  
                In saying this, I know that the next few weeks will be difficult and there may be times when the team can’t provide 100% of the usual support.  
                I understand that we will have individual support to help us with developing our core skills and that this is scheduled.  
                I also understand that there will be technical support - but again this is limited to what the team can provide 
                based on BAU - not my whims and fancies. 
            </P>

          <h3> What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</h3>
              <p> 
                My expectation is that I make the most of my time and take full advantage of this unique opportunity. 
                This means making an effort to understand everyone around me and to work with them in a positive and productive manner.  
                It means that I will have to manage myself well through self-care.  
                There are probably going to be a few times when I feel that things have moved faster than I would have liked - especially technical lessons.  
                Foundations has taught me that there are caring people around who will help me get up to speed provided I ask for help in a positive way.  
              </p>

          <h3> Based on your knowledge of Bootcamp, how and where will you seek help in a timely way? </h3>
              <p> 
                I understand that I will have a human skills facilitator with whom I will have a 1:1 every second week to support my emotional well-being. 
                I know that EDA has a counselling service for students so should I need urgent emotional support for some reason, I will ask to be connected to 
                this service or something else deemed relevant. Regarding support with technical skills,  I will keep note of my technical skills concerns
                discuss them with the person leading my Tech-in at the end of each technical phase. 
                I will reflect on my technical and emotional concerns at the start of each week for 20 minutes and update my learning plan and focus for the week 
                - both technical and emotional.  
              </p>

      <h2>My learning plan &#127891; </h2>

        <h3> Long-term career goal </h3>
          <p> 
            Be a self-employed web development consultant or work for a company that advocates for a better internet!
          </p>

        <h3>Learning strengths and limitations</h3>
          <P> 
            I am very resilient and I can stay calm if I have to start again - better to redo work than do it all wrong!
            I am creative and I enjoy problem-solving and trying to learn about computers and the web! A weakness is that 
            I like to consider things deeply and there isn't always time.  
           
          </P>

        <h3>Human skills I would like to develop at EDA</h3>
          <p>
            Self-compassion, teamwork, and communication
          </p>

        <h3>How I will manage my workload</h3>
          <p> 
            I am treating my study like a full-time job. I work set hours (40+ per week) and take breaks.
          </p>

        <h3>Actions I will take if things are building up and getting to me</h3>
          <p> I will book an appointment with my facilitator to make a plan, if required.  
            But going for a walk and having some food and water is a good first step!
          </p>
        
        <h3>How and where I will seek help in a timely way</h3>
          <p> 
            I will reach out for help in the foundations channel if I am stuck on a problem for over 20 minutes.  
            If that isn’t working then I will contact my facilitator for one-to-one help. 
          </p>
        
        <h3>What I expect from the facilitation team</h3>
          <p> 
            Support in Slack Channels, one-to-ones, and understanding of my learning differences and strengths.
          </p>

        <h3>Scheduling info and other commitments</h3>
        <p> 
          I have very good availability between 10am to 2:30pm during foundations. I am also available after 8pm when my toddler is a sleep.
          I know that I have to be available for the set hours during Bootcamp. I have an all day appointment on Monday 14 February 2022.
