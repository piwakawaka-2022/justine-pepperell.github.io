<h2>My learning plan &#127891; </h2>

<h3> Long-term career goal </h3>
<p> Be a self-employed web development consultant or work for a company that advocates for a better internet!</p>

<h3>Learning strengths and limitations</h3>
<P> 
  I am very resilient and I can stay calm if I have to start again - better to redo work than do it all wrong!
  I am creative and I enjoy problem-solving and trying to learn about computers and the web! 
  One limitation of mine is that I am very visual and sometimes I don't understand purely text-based instructions well, especially if there are several in a row.
  I like to talk through my "plans" so I can get them clear in my head. If I receive a list of too many things "to do" I can feel overwhelmed and not know where to start - like tidying my house! 
</P>

<h3>Human skills I would like to develop at EDA</h3>
<p>Self-compassion, teamwork, and communication </p>

<h3>How I will manage my workload</h3>
<p> I am treating my study like a full-time job. I work set hours (40+ per week) and take breaks.</p>

<h3>Actions I will take if things are builidng up and getting to me</h3>
<p> I will book an appointment with my facilitator to make a plan, if required.  But going for a walk and having some food and water is a good first step!</p>
<h3>How and where I will seek help in a timely way</h3>
<p> I will reach out for help in the foundations channel if I am stuck on a problem for over 20 minutes.  If that isn’t working then I will contact my facilitator for one-to-one help. </p>
<h3>What I expect from the faciliation team</h3>
<p> Support in Slack Channels, one-to-ones, and understanding of my learning differences and strengths.</p>

<h3>Scheduling info and other commitments</h3>
<p> 
  I have very good availablity between 10am to 2:30pm during foundations. I am also available after 8pm when my toddler is a sleep.
  I know that I have to be available for the set hours during bootcamp. I have an all day appointment on Monday 14 February 2022. </p>
