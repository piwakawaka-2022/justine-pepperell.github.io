        <h4> Story and reflection: a time I got blocked on a simple problem &#129327; </h4>
            <p>
                During this sprint we did an activity called Zen Garden. We were given some messy code and a loose guide on how to format it 
                to best practice (which is up for debate like everything in web development). 
                My initial approach was to read information on best practices and then just try to tidy up the code by “just trying something”. 
                I hit a few walls during this problem-solving activity. Firstly, I thought I liked two tabs for indenting but then thought this looked too spaced out 
                and was perhaps not helping readability so I decided to start the activity over when I was close to 
                being finished: not a good decision nor effective time management! 
            </p>
            <p> 
                I ended up asking a course friend (ask a peer for help) how they approached the activity and they suggested that I use an extension 
                called Highlight Matching Tag.  We also discussed indenting and they advised that they used two tabs per indent but set each 
                tab to two spaces. Following this conversation, I committed to an indenting width and installed Highlight Matching Tag.  
                I formatted the document from top to bottom - focusing on creating a consistent indenting pattern to enhance readability of the code.  
                Using Highlight Matching Tag made it easier for me to feel sure of where I was indenting as I had previously really struggled 
                to follow the indenting lines and understand which elements were encased inside each other - especially when trying to follow 
                long divs and asides down the page.  I have always laboured over visual tracking of menial details, which is kind of embarrassing 
                as it's a simple skill that can cause roadblocks for me, while I am learning a new skill.  The issue tends to disapate 
                as I become comfortable with content and find my way - this will take time with coding.    
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I learnt that essentially, I started solving this problem without a strategy and this was not a good approach for this type of problem 
                and my natural tendencies - what was good enough? I didn’t define that for myself and became increasingly confused about how 
                far I was from being “finished”.  The longer it took me to solve the problem the more stressed I felt about it. 
                I think some planning similar to “pseudocoding” would have been beneficial when solving this problem.     
            </p>
        
            <h4> Solved a problem in an elegant way &#129417; </h4>
            <p>    
                During this sprint I had to research 2 JavaScript Methods and create code examples using the code methods with explanations 
                of why I might use the methods.   I initially did a lot of googling and then used pseudocode to plan the logic of what I would 
                need the functions to do.  I then thought of examples where the method could be useful and rewrote the function code to provide 
                the desired output. Lastly, when the first method still wasn’t quite working, I asked a peer to help me work through the last few steps.
                Because of my initial groundwork, I was able to ask for help in a way that was clear regarding what I needed to understand. 
                Asking for help felt okay because my ground work showed I wasn’t just asking for the answer.  
                After talking through my thinking and problem solving steps with my peer (essentially the rubber duckie method) 
                I was able to figure out how to adapt my code and finish the method. 
                And, with true elegance, I did the above again without asking a peer for help and completed the second method myself.   
                I felt happy and empowered with how I approached these challenges - it felt like honest progress! 
                I learnt planning your problem-solving is so important because it also helps others to understand what you are thinking when you ask them for help.  
                People enjoy helping others, provided they can figure out how to help - without sacrificing their own work schedule!    
            </p>

            <H4>Reflection: confidence using common problem-solving techniques</H4>
            <P>
                Pseudocode: seems very effective; however, sometimes I am not sure where to start!; 
                Trying something: this can work well for me - but it can also just cause me more problems; 
                Rubber ducky method: it is always good to articulate your problem and see if this helps your brain solve the problem - 
                I’ve stolen my son’s rubber duck; 
                Reading error messages: I am still developing this skill; 
                Console.logging: I am also still developing this skill;
                Googling: I am confident with Googling but not always confident that I am not going down the rabbit hole;  
                Asking your peers for help: I find this quite hard in the slack channels as it feels embarrassing; 
                Asking coaches for help: I am okay with this but sometimes don’t want to bother people; 
                Improving your process with reflection: I have used reflective practice in other jobs and it can be very powerful.
