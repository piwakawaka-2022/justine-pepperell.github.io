<h2>Intro/context</h2>

<p> W3 Schools, provides the following explaination of what CSS is within the process of web development, </p>
    
   <p> "Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to format the layout of a webpage after the structure has been defined using html.
    With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements, how elements are positioned and laid out, what background images 
    or background colors are to be used, different displays for different devices and screen sizes, and much more". </p>
    
    <p>And the following important tip,</p>
    
    <p> "Tip: The word cascading means that a style applied to a parent element will also apply to all children elements within the parent. 
    So, if you set the color of the body text to "blue", all headings, paragraphs, and other text elements within the body will also get the same color 
    (unless you specify something else)!" </p>
    
    <p> The first layer of styling you would apply to your html document is element styling, but as stated above 
    - this only provides limited styling options because each element can only take one set of style instructions.
    The syntax for basic element styling in css looks like this,</p>
    
   <div> <img src="..\images\img_element-selector.jpg" alt="CSS element selector code"> </div> 
    
    <p> The result of running the above syntax is that every element in your html doc tag with h1 will take the style of verdana font and the size of 20px. 
    Element selectors help you keep your code simple by applying the styling to all elements on a page of that type. 
    This means you only have to keep track of your styles for those elements in one place. </p>
    
    <p> Attribute selectors like .class and #id (there are many more) allow developers to layer additional styling (or remove it) across html code files.  
    .class and #id are more advanced attribute selectors, which appear to create the same result across html files; 
    however, there are clear best practies governing when to use them. </p>

    
    
  <h3> Best practice when using .class and #id attribute selectors </h3>
    
  <h4> CSS #id attribule selector </h4>
    
   <P> The id selector selects the HTML elements that have an id attribute that matches the selector. 
    As you cannot have more than one element with the same id in a HTML document, this selector allows you to select an individual element. 
    This means that the styling on the selected element will be unique. 
    If you think you will use this styling again on the same element somewhere else across you webpage, and a simple element selector won't do, 
    consider creating a .class attribute selector. </P>
    
    <p> The syntax for creating a #id attribute selector looks like this:</p>
    
    <img src="..\images\img_id-syntax.jpg" alt="id syntax example">    
    
    <h4>CSS .class attribute selector </h4>
    
   <p> The HTML .class attribute is used to specify a class for an HTML element.
    Multiple HTML elements can share the same class.
    
    <p> How to use it: The class attribute is often used to point to a class name in a style sheet. 
    It can also be used by a JavaScript to access and manipulate elements with the specific class name (I don't know JavaScript yet). </p>
    
   </p>The syntax to create a .class attribute looks like this in your html file: </p>

    <img src="..\images\img_multiple-classes.jpg" alt="example of multiple classes applied to one attribute">


<h3>Analogy </h3>
<p> Imagine your website is a new subdivision. It will one day contain 1000 houses but for now it will just have 20. 
  You have been asked to choose 5 roof colours, 5 exterior wall colours, and 5 door colours that can be used across the subdivision. 
  You like the combination of a red roof, white exterior, and a blue door. You think that more than one house will probably end up being painted in this colour scheme so you write it down with specifications about shades and paint grades and give it the name of “Noddy” 
  for future reference by exterior decorators. If you relate this example to coding your webpage, this is a time when creating a class would be useful. 
  You find out that all houses can have circle or square windows. So you create two “window classes”. 
  The house styled with “Noddy” can also be styled with either of the window style classes. Elements can be styled by more than one class. However, this can potentially lead to conflicts XXX. </p>
  
  <p>Next you find out that you are allowed to create one unique visual feature for this subdivision. You decide to paint the main road with a rainbow mural. 
  No other street in the subdivision is permitted to be painted like a rainbow - this is a strict order. Referring back to your website, this scenario is when you would create a #id to style an element. 
  Often #ids are used on headers on landing pages - but they can be used anywhere provided there is only a need for one, and only ONE! </p>
  
  <p>After all this fussy about #id rules, you might be surprised to know that they are not essential. 
  Your website can function just fine without one.</p> 
  
 <p> Justine, .class and #id sounds complicated, do I really need them? 
  Well, you can actually style a webpage by simply directing css to element tags in your html - but the end result might not be a huge improvement on an html document without any help from CSS. 
  Thinking about your subvision, there would only be one colour scheme used and all the homes would have the same window - AND, there would be no rainbow road. That said, you should think about how your site 
  will scale when creating classes to avoid unecessary complexity of code and conflicts - which could make site maintenace tricky in the future. Complexity can also cause accessability issues for some website users.

<h3> My blog and .class & #id </h3>
<p>I have created a #id for the styling of my header on my home page. 
I have created a .class for turning mid paragraph word blue - I am using this on words that describe my values. 
Neither of these were necessary - and probably aren't asthetically pleasing but creating and applying them provided good practise. </p>
