<body>
<h1> class vs #id</h1>

<h2>Analogy: Your webpage is like houses on a street </h2>
<p>
  Imagine your website is a street. The street contains 100 houses. Each house has 1 unique attribute but may share various attributes with the other houses on the street. Each house has one #id its house number. 
  In contrast, 50/100 houses have a grey roof. Thus, grey roof is a perfect candidate for a class. 25/100 houses have a white exterior thus this will also suit being a class.  5/100 houses (numbers 1, 5, 7, 15) have a grey roof, white exterior, and a red door. Three classes are applied to these houses. 
  There is only one house on the street with a purple roof (number 22); however, there’s no reason other roofs can’t be repainted purple in the future so although this attribute is unique to house number 22, the attribute of purple roof should be a .class not a #id. 
</p>
 <h2> Do developers need to apply classes? </h2> 
  <p> They don’t - but it makes web pages beautiful, improves readability, and helps with keeping styling consistent and efficient. Without using classes, CSS could still give every house a grey roof, white exterior, and a red door by using element tagging but different combinations of roof, exterior, and door colour wouldn’t be possible. 
  The number systems would still exist to help the courier do his job provided a #id specifying house number was applied to each house, but taking a walk around the neighbourhood might be a little boring. 
  Best practice If a house painter could be done painting in an instant, like CSS can be with styling elements on an html document, they would be grateful for classes - although less available overall and a limit on classes per house would be preferable in a new subdivision where 500 homes need styling within a limited budget and short-timeframe (much like a data rich web page or perhaps on a small blog created by a noobie).  
  </p>
  
 <p><strong>Tip:</strong>if you don’t need a class, don’t use one. And if you use a #id, make sure you only use one per webpage. Unlike a street, where every house needs a number, not using a #id won’t ruin your webpage.
