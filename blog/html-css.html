<h1> .class vs #id</h1>

<h2>Analogy </h2>
<p>
  Imagine your website is a new subdivison that will one day contain 1000 houses but for now will just have 20. You have been asked to choose 5 roof colours, 5 exterior wall colours, and 5 door colours that can be used across the subdivison.
  You decided that you like the combination of a red roof, white exterior, and a blue door. It seems likely that more than one house will eventually use this colour scheme so you call it Noddy and specifiy its attributes for future reference. 
  When creating a CSS style sheet for a website, this would be an opportunity to create a class. You continue creating colour schemes based on possible colour combinations.  
 
  In contrast, 50/100 houses have a grey roof. Thus, grey roof is a perfect candidate for a class. 25/100 houses have a white exterior thus this will also suit being a class.  5/100 houses (numbers 1, 5, 7, 15) have a grey roof, white exterior, and a red door. Three classes are applied to these houses. 
  There is only one house on the street with a purple roof (number 22); however, there’s no reason other roofs can’t be repainted purple in the future so although this attribute is unique to house number 22, the attribute of purple roof should be a .class not a #id. 
</p>
 <h2> Do developers need to apply classes? </h2> 
  <p> They don’t - but it makes web pages beautiful, improves readability, and helps with keeping styling consistent and efficient. Without using classes, CSS could still give every house a grey roof, white exterior, and a red door by using element tagging but different combinations of roof, exterior, and door colour wouldn’t be possible. 
  The number systems would still exist to help the courier do his job provided a #id specifying house number was applied to each house, but taking a walk around the neighbourhood might be a little boring. 
  Best practice If a house painter could be done painting in an instant, like CSS can be with styling elements on an html document, they would be grateful for classes - although less available overall and a limit on classes per house would be preferable in a new subdivision where 500 homes need styling within a limited budget and short-timeframe (much like a data rich web page or perhaps on a small blog created by a noobie).  
  </p>
  
 <p><strong>Best practice tip:</strong>if you don’t need a class, don’t use one. And if you use a #id, make sure you only use one per webpage and for one element such as your site's header. Unlike a street, where every house needs a number, not using a #id won’t ruin your webpage.
