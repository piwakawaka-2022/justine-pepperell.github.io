<h3>Analogy </h3>
<p> Imagine your website is a new subdivision. It will one day contain 1000 houses but for now it will just have 20. 
  You have been asked to choose 5 roof colours, 5 exterior wall colours, and 5 door colours that can be used across the subdivision. 
  You like the combination of a red roof, white exterior, and a blue door. You think that more than one house will probably end up being painted in this colour scheme so you write it down with specifications about shades and paint grades and give it the name of “Noddy” 
  for future reference by exterior decorators. If you relate this example to coding your webpage, this is a time when creating a class would be useful. 
  You find out that all houses can have circle or square windows. So you create two “window classes”. 
  The house styled with “Noddy” can also be styled with either of the window style classes. Elements can be styled by more than one class. However, this can potentially lead to conflicts XXX. </p>
  
  <p>Next you find out that you are allowed to create one unique visual feature for this subdivision. You decide to paint the main road with a rainbow mural. 
  No other street in the subdivision is permitted to be painted like a rainbow - this is a strict order. Referring back to your website, this scenario is when you would create a #id to style an element. 
  Often #ids are used on headers on landing pages - but they can be used anywhere provided there is only a need for one, and only ONE! </p>
  
  <p>After all this fussy about #id rules, you might be surprised to know that they are not essential. 
  Your website can function just fine without one.</p> 
  
 <p> Justine, .class and #id sounds complicated, do I really need them? 
  Well, you can actually style a webpage by simply directing css to element tags in your html - but the end result might not be a huge improvement on an html document without any help from CSS. 
  Thinking about your subvision, there would only be one colour scheme used and all the homes would have the same window - AND, there would be no rainbow road. That said, you should think about how your site 
  will scale when creating classes to avoid unecessary complexity of code and conflicts - which could make site maintenace tricky in the future. Complexity can also cause accessability issues for some website users.

<h3> My blog and .class & #id </h3>
<p>I have created a #id for the styling of my header on my home page. 
I have created a .class for turning mid paragraph word blue - I am using this on words that describe my values. 
Neither of these were necessary - and probably aren't asthetically pleasing but creating and applying them provided good practise. </p>
