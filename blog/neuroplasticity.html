        <h3>Neuroplasticity & Growth Mindset</h3>
        
            <h4> What is Neuroplasticity?</h4>
                <p> 
                    Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to change shape and form new connections that support it to function efficiently. 
                </p>

            <h4> Why is Neuroplasticity important? </h4> 
                <p>
                    Neuroplasticity is an important concept in brain rehabilitation; 
                    it’s also applicable to people’s ability to learn new skills (even those at which they appear to be inherently bad). 
                    Scientists previously thought that people had fixed cognitive abilities - this is why it used to be very popular to screen the population
                    via IQ tests and stream people into classes and professions based on their IQ scores. 
                    Many medical professionals in their late 60s will tell you that they were assessed as being “gifted” at school 
                    while a truck driver the same age will likely tell you they left school at fifteen and it wasn’t for them because they aren’t very smart. 
                    I have heard this story many times in my career development work, which is pretty sad.  

                    Historically, the idea of fixed cognitive abilities was also applied to survivors of strokes and traumatic brain injuries.  
                    For many years scientists believed that brains couldn’t heal following trauma. 
                    However, in recent years, scientists have discovered that brains are in fact “plastic”meaning: brains are capable of changing shape 
                    and forming new connections to compensate for damaged or dead cells. 
                    Similarly, we now know that people (young and old) regardless of IQ or learning disabilities, have cognitive abilities that can grow. 
                    
                
                </p>

            <h4> What is Growth Mindset?</h4>
                <p>
                    Growth mindset is, in simple terms, a person's belief about their abilities - are they innate (fixed at birth) 
                    or the result of consistent effort and constantly growing. 
                </p>

            <h4>Why is Growth Mindset important?</h4>
                <p> 
                    Education scientists have found, when success is attributed to effort - ability growth is measurable across all sections and subsections of society. 
                    This includes groups of people historically considered incapable of educational achievement. 
                    Growth Mindset is key to accessing the “plastic” nature of the brain and achieving enhanced cognition. 
                </p>
            <h4> My thoughts on Growth Mindset and leanring</h4>    
                <p>
                    The majority of adults have brain germs (self-limiting beliefs about their cognitive abilities) in at least one area of their life. 
                    Although I am well-versed in growth mindset and neuroplasticity from my previous careers, 
                    I will benefit from incorporating a growth mindset into my studies and learning plan while at EDA. 
                    I have a few “brain germs” at the moment. 
                    Why? Because historically the prevalent idea about who could become a “developer” was that it requires a mind that 
                    is inherently excellent at mathematical thinking.  During my time at EDA, it will be crucial that I apply a growth mindset 
                    and remember that I am capable of learning more advanced mathematical concepts. 
                    For me, it will be important to remember that reshaping my brain in this way will probably make me feel uncomfortable at times. 
                    BUT that pain will equal gain, and I will improve my skills. 
                </p>
    
            <h4> Ways to engage the power of neuroplasticity </h4>
                <p>         
                    There are many practical ways to engage the concepts of neuroplasticity and growth mindset while learning. 
                    Practising new skills as much as possible and in different contexts really helps to build new connections in the brain.  
                    Brain connections are like highways, the ones with the most traffic get the most maintenance and eventual expansion. 
                    A big part of fueling brain growth is making sure you are in the right learning zone.  
                    It’s also the reason we get asked which learning zone we were in during the sprint in the end of sprint feedback we provide EDA 
                    each week.  EDA is helping us to reshape our brains! if you haven’t heard of learning zones,

            <h4>Reflectioning on my learning journey at EDA </h4>        
                <p>
                    While researching growth mindset and neuroplasticity, I have released that at the end of each week, 
                    when I post my feedback and I am always in the “edge of panic zone” that this is not something to feel ashamed of,  
                    it it is something to celebrate - it signals that my brain is growing and abilities are being stretched. 
                    Being on the edge of Panic is okay, but not very sustainable, likely a reason that I am feeling exhausted! 
                    This week I took a little extra time with things, went for a walk in the sun with a friend, did extra meditations via the Calm website. 
                    Attending EDA has really challenged me to confront some fixed views I have held about some of my abilities for many years.
