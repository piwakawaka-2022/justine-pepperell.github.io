        <h2> JavaScript basics</h2>
            <h3> What is the relationship between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript?</h3>
                <p>
                    It's complicated. HTML and CSS are interdependent - the need each other. JavaScript makes their work more dynamic  
                    but they can live without JavaScript.  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript layer over one another nicely to support the construction of a modern 
                    web application. Yes, in just three weeks, I have already been learning three programming languages? Why? Because they are a powerful trio. 
                    HTML is the builder, they lay the foundations of your house, build its framing, add roofing materials, and drywall.  
                    When the builder is done you have something solid, safe, effective, yet uncomfortable and unattractive. 
                    CCS is the stylist who finds the right carpet, drapes, furniture, paint colours, when CSS is done - you have a comfortable space.  
                    JavaScript is the robotics engineer. They figure out how features of the house should be programmed to help you live your best life at home. 
                    The engineer sets up smart heating, lighting, electronic garage doors, security systems 
                    - everyday there are new ways to make your house “smarter”. HTML =  web application structure, CSS = style, JavaScript = behaviour & interactivity.

        <h3> Control flow and loops </h3>
            <p> 
                Before you can understand why developers love loops, we need to understand the concept of  the control flow. 
                Basically, computers run on logic and default systems - this is the order  the computer executes statements in a script.  
                Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across conditionals or loops that change the course of the control flow. 
                Without conditionals or loops, it would be really hard to programme an interactive website - loops and conditionals are part of JavaScript’s superpowers.  

                Waitstaff at fine dining establishments don’t just follow the standard control flow of: take orders, serve food, clear tables, take payments.  
                The refill water glass loop starts some time after you sit down, and then every time your water glass is empty the waiter refills it until you get up and leave the table.  
                The same with your wine glass; however, the termination of this loop should be more complex as the waitperson should be judging whether you are too intoxicated to be on premises - all though in programming it's probably still a binary decision. Lol. 
                
                
                With web applications and JavaScript, it’s possible to use loops to provide user(s) an enhanced experience. For example, an ecommerce website’s check out might have a Javascript loop (running in the background) that calculates the total cost of all the items in the shopping trolley. 
                The loop can be written so each time a new item is added it starts counting the list of items again and provides a new total.  
                Imagine how annoyed a retail shop assistant would be if you changed your final purchases 10 times before paying and made her tally and retally the total.

        <h3>Interacting with the DOM </h3>
            <p> 
                The DOM (Document Object Model) , a model of your website's source code documents, (and everything happening on your website) is a handy tool 
                that lets developers view the document object model - a tree-like version of everything behind the website you view through your browser.  
                Via the DOM, you can understand how a website was constructed using html, CSS, JavaScript, and more! You can grab elements and experiment with changing their content and appearance. 
                You can also test your code as you go - this makes the life of a web developer much easier.

            <h3> The difference between accessing data from arrays and objects </h3>
                <p>
                    Objects represent ‘things’ with characteristics (aka properties) they take a name - just like they do in English.  Below is an example of a JavaScript object called ‘car’. 
                    The curly brackets contain a set of characteristics that tell us about the ‘car’. In JavaScript the characteristics of an object are called properties 
                    and they consist of a key and a value, example below.
                    <img src="..\images\img-object.jpg" alt="Object Syntax" class ="syntax">
                </p> 
                <P>
                    If we want to access properties in objects, we can do so with either dot or bracket notation. 
                    To get the value of the ‘model’ key in our ‘car’ object with both dot and bracket notation, 
                    we’d write:
                    <img src="..\images\img-object-access.jpg" alt="How to access object data syntax" class ="syntax">
                </P>
                <p>
                    Arrays create and store lists of data in a single variable. The array below provides a string of car makes. 
                    <img src="..\images\img-array.jpg" alt="array syntax" class ="syntax">
                </p>
                <p>
                    Arrays are often used when creating ordered collections because arrays are zero-indexed: the first element of an array is at index zero, the second at index 1, 
                    and so on with the last element being the value of the array’s length - 1. To access the first element of the array, we would write: 
                    <img src="..\images\img-array-access.jpg" alt="access to array data syntax" class ="syntax">
                </p>  
              
             <h3>What are functions and why are they useful?</h3>
                <p> 
                    Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. 
                    A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedure (like a chocolate cake recipe)—a set of statements that performs a task, 
                    but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output 
                    (ingredients + processed according to recipe = chocolate cake). To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it 
                    (if you don’t write your recipe down and call it Chocolate Cake Recipe (declare it) and explain the method (list the steps involved), how would anyone know what it is for or what to do with the ingredients - could be a facemask, ya know?). 
                    Also,if you want someone to make you a chocolate cake using the recipe, you'll have to explicity ask them to do so (call the function)
