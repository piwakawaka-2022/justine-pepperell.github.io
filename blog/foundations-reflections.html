        <h3> What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h3>
            <p>
                1. Like most, I have an excitable ego - it likes boosts, dislikes blows, and pandering fuels it. 
                2. I hate asking for help. 
                3. If I ask for help nothing bad will happen - BUT EGO WILL BE ANNOYED.  
            </p>
        
        <h3> What are the role of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
            <p>
                Values drive motivation so ensuring they are engaged during the learning journey is very important. 
                Learning speeds and roadblocks are different for each individual.  
                Being aware of your own mental state is key to staying in the learning zone and avoiding burnout that can occur when you push  
                yourself too hard without asking for support, which is probably close by.  
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Programming is about solving problems - hard problems, so you need to know why you are investing your time into programming, 
                and to remember that great code “stands on the shoulders of giants”. 
                It’s usually not your job to reinvent the wheel and it’s important to understand the value of your fellow programmers – even if they are very different to you.  
                When we help build the internet - if we aren’t actively being inclusive then we are likely creating something inaccessible and exclusive that simply 
                serves people like us.  Knowing your own values can help you to understand who you might unintentionally be excluding as you build applications. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Empathy can be described as the ability to sense other people's emotions, coupled with the ability to imagine what someone else might be thinking or feeling.  
                So empathy is actually lateral thinking - which is often key to solving technical problems. 
                It’s useful to be able to think laterally about how people might interact with applications, how to write code, 
                and how you can best use the resources available to you. 
            </p>


        <h3> What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
            <p> 
                That it has been of great benefit to me.  Even reviewing concepts I already knew about like neuroplasticity and growth-mindset 
                because I was actually engaging in very challenging learning that I wasn't immediately successful in (not yet), which made core learning extremely relevant. 
            </p>
        
        <h3> What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
            <p>
                Honestly, writing these blogs about core learning - I didn’t want to publish them because I felt they weren’t good enough.
            </p>
 
        <h3> Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course? </h3>
            <p>
             Because higher EQ actually makes a person a more efficient programmer and improving this area of your thinking will  make you better faster than anything else.  
             Oh, and it makes it easier to work effectively with others - this will make having a lasting career a lot more likely.  
            </p>

        <h3> Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time?</h3>
            <p>
            No.
            </p>

        <h3> Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? </h3> 
            <p> 
             No. I can practise programming anytime. But having a group of classmates to explore core principles with while also learning programming skills 
             is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity so thank you for prioritising core learning! It’s what’s making this experience special.
