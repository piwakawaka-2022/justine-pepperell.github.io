    <h2> Sprint 1: My values & identity </h2>
    <h3/> My values, culture, and identity </h3>
    
    <p> <span class="value">Openness:</span>  I am curious about the world: it’s natural rhythms, wonders, and human inhabitants. I don’t think there is one correct way to live. I dislike exclusive cliques and the phenomenon of “groupthink”.  
    I tend to see the world as a giant tapestry where everything is somehow connected.  In keeping with these personality traits my Myers Briggs personality profile is ENFP “The Campaigner”. </p>
    <p> <span class="value">Creativity:</span>  being creative helps me to feel well, to process my feelings, to maintain hope, and solve problems.  </p> 
    <p> <span class="value"> Fun:</span> life and work should be fun if possible - having fun and playing is how children best learn - why shouldn’t it be the same for adults!? </p>
    <p> <span class="value">Integrity:</span> if nobody kept to their word the world would be a very confusing and unenjoyable place, so I try my best to live my values and honour my word and commitments. </p> 
    <p> <span class="value">Empathy:</span> understanding that we all have challenges and struggles in life, visible and/or invisible. I try to recognise other people’s emotions in situations and be kind, even if they are different from how I would react. Being empathetic isn’t always easy, and being empathetic with yourself can be very difficult - I am working on this. </p> 
    <p> <span class="value">Fairness:</span>treating people impartially and justly by abstaining from favouritism and/or discrimination. </p>

    <h3>My culture</h3>
    <p>
      Culture is a set of shared values and preferences for how groups of people interact with the world and the people around them. 
      My family is of Scottish, Irish, and English heritage but in the context of Aotearoa, we are Pākehā - not British. 
      We have been in New Zealand since the late 1800s. As a Pākehā I am a member of the dominant cultural group - 
      Māori and other ethnic minorities tend to have very different world views - often more collectivist. 
      My Pākehā culture has made me very independent. Although I have close relationships with my family - 
      I tend to see myself as an independent individual, which is reflected in the way I live. 
      For example, we don’t have parents (mine or my partners) living in our home - this is also a preference held by our Pākehā parents. 
      My family history has also influenced my values. My great-great-grandmother signed the NZ women’s suffrage petition. 
      She fought for equal rights for women. She was married, had 14 children, and worked informally as a midwife helping 
      isolated women in the Catlins. A number of my family members are quite focused on social justice, 
      this is part of our family culture. I often find myself drawn to work and activities that focus on social justice or helping people.

    <h3> A time my values were tested </h3>
    <p>
      <b>Situation:</b> I once assessed a client for X, the client happened to also work in the system. 
      The client was highly distressed by their personal circumstances. Unfortunately, they were so distressed and anxious that 
      they decided to try to play the “I deserve special treatment card” and posed a thinly veiled threat that they 
      could make things better or worse for my employer through their position should I not make the suggestions they considered to be optimal”. 
      This client's behaviour was challenging for me on two levels. Firstly, I completely understood their distress, 
      and also what they wanted - although it wasn’t possible. Secondly, I was appalled by their blatant request for favouritism. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
      <b>Task:</b> in this situation, it was important that I act with fairness, integrity, but also empathy. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
      <b>Action:</b> I expressed empathy for the client's situation but reiterated the rules governing my pending 
      recommendations and advised I had heard their aspirations and would do what I could to accommodate them. 
      I felt very anxious about my final assessment as I wondered if the client would decide to make complaints about me, 
      which I knew would not go anywhere but would not be fun for me. I discussed the situation and my feelings with my manager 
      and completed the assessment as I would for any other client. My manager was kind and reassured me that I always go 
      for the best solutions for every client because I listen to their needs and do my best within the system. 
      He said had no doubts about my competence. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
      <b>Result:</b>ultimately although I felt a little rattled by the client, I knew that I had acted with empathy, fairness, and integrity.
      </p>
      

    <h3>Career and learning: strengths and limitations </h3>
    
    <p>
      I took the Gallup Strengths assessment and found that my two main strengths are “ideation” and “learner”. 
      Historically my work colleagues have always said that I am able to look at situations from alternative perspectives, 
      which makes me strong at helping clients and optimizing the use of resources available within the rules. 
      My colleagues have also congratulated me on my thirst for knowledge and willingness to learn and apply new techniques. 
      However, I believe that my strength in "ideation" can also lead to unhelpful rumination when my anxiety levels are high. 
      Similarly, “learner” can be a limitation when I am under time pressure to complete a new task but keep wanting to know why, why, why? 
      Luckily, I am a very resilient person and can cope with high levels of uncertainty and change-able work environments. 
      On the flip side, this strength can make me find easy and routine tasks very difficult to focus on. 
      I tend to prefer the "too hard" basket to easy routine tasks.
