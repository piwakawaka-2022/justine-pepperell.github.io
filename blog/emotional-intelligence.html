    <h1> Emotional Intelligence: Exploring EI vs IQ </h1>

    <h3> What is emotional intelligence?</h3>
    <p> Experts commonly define EQ as: the ability to understand, use, and manage your own emotions in positive ways to relieve stress, communicate effectively, empathise with others, 
        overcome challenges and defuse conflict. Real world examples of this are knowing how to cheer someone up or help them to calm down if they are distressed. 
        Being able to make others feel that you are truly listening to them - not just judging them or looking to find a way to reply makes them “wrong” and you “right”. 
    </p>

    <h3> How is emotional intelligence different to IQ? </h3>
    <p> IQ, is a traditional measurement of “intelligence” measures a person’s cognitive abilities in areas including verbal comprehension, perceptual reason, working memory scale, and processing. 
    IQ tests were developed as a way of screening the population for “potential” in professions such as engineering, law, and science. 
    Traditional IQ testing fails to consider a person's EQ and how it will influence their ability to solve problems in the real world.</p> 

    <h3> Why is emotional intelligence important?</h3>
    <p>  EQ is extremely important as without it a person is unlikely to successfully apply their IQ to solving problems in the real world. 
        Real-world problems involve people, and are extremely messy because of human factors.  
        EQ is crucial to real world problem-solving as  it requires self-confidence,  effective communication, conflict management, motivation to persist, 
        and empathy to understand the feelings and motivations of others. Being able to regulate your own emotions and actions is also extremely important.
