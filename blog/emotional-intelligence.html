    <h2> Emotional Intelligence: Exploring EQ vs IQ </h2>

    <h3> What is emotional intelligence?</h3>
    <p> Experts commonly define emotional intelligence as: the ability to understand, use, and manage your own emotions in positive ways to relieve stress, communicate effectively, empathise with others, 
        overcome challenges and defuse conflict. Real world examples of this are knowing how to cheer someone up or help them to calm down if they are distressed. 
        Being able to make others feel that you are truly listening to them - not just judging them or looking to find a way to reply that makes them “wrong” and you “right”. 
    </p>

    <h3> How is EQ different to IQ? </h3>
    <p> IQ, is a traditional measurement of “intelligence” measures a person’s cognitive abilities in areas including verbal comprehension, perceptual reason, working memory scale, and processing. 
    IQ tests were developed as a way of screening the population for “potential” in professions such as engineering, law, and science. 
    Traditional IQ testing fails to consider a person's EQ and how it will influence their ability to solve problems in the real world.</p> 

    <h3> Why is emotional intelligence important?</h3>
    <p>  EQ is extremely important as without it a person is unlikely to successfully apply their IQ to solving problems in the real world. 
        Real-world problems involve people and are messy because of human factors, which IQ alone cannot solve.   
        EQ is crucial to real world problem-solving, which requires self-confidence,  effective communication, conflict management, motivation to persist, 
        and empathy to understand the feelings and motivations of others. Being able to regulate your own emotions and actions is also extremely important. 
        After working in "human services" for over 8 years, I can say being able to cheers others up, calm them down, and know when that isn't your job is key in avoiding emotional burnout. 
        Empathy fatigue is an occupational hazzard in human services. This is where EQ directed towards one's own self and situation is extremely important. 
        Just as one may benefit from a plan to "develop their professional skills" we can all benefit from a "self-care plan" counselling/debreifing as required and taking time before it becomes a necesity.  
        There is an old saying, "nobody ever died from a papercut" that I've heard touted around pressure cooker coporate environments. 
        This type of statement lacks EQ and empathy for others and probably never cheered anyone up, ever! 
        Google came to understand the importance of emotionally intelligent staff some years ago and has its own emotional intelligence curriculum called Search Inside Yourself - if only all companies could invest like this in EQ training.
